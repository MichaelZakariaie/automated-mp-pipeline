## Current Session Goals

### Primary Objectives
- [x] ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Create .gitignore file to exclude environment files and artifacts
- [x] ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Add history tracking instructions to CLAUDE.md
- [x] ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Create CODE_HISTORY.md for session continuity
- [x] ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Create TODO.md for active task tracking

### Secondary/Future Tasks
- [ ] üîÑ **PENDING**: Test pipeline with real AWS credentials (when available)
- [ ] üîÑ **PENDING**: Add performance benchmarking for large datasets
- [ ] üîÑ **PENDING**: Create additional cohort configurations as needed
- [ ] üîÑ **NEXT SESSION**: Propose additional CLAUDE.md instructions/guidelines that might be useful, get user approval, then add selected ones to the file

## Notes and Context

### Current Status
**PIPELINE IS COMPLETE AND READY FOR USE**
- All core functionality implemented and tested
- Documentation complete
- Two-command operation working
- Multi-environment setup robust

### User Intentions
- Wanted unified "two-button" operation for yochlol + tabular_modeling
- Needed cohort-specific configuration management
- Required both AWS and local CV processing modes
- Emphasized maintaining full original functionality

### What Works vs. Needs Testing
**Works Robustly**:
- Multi-environment setup and execution
- Cohort switching and configuration
- CV data generation
- Pipeline orchestration
- Command-line interface

**Needs Real-World Testing**:
- AWS credential integration
- Large dataset performance
- External team integration points

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Setup (one-time)
./setup_multi_env.sh

# Two-button operation
./run_time_series_multi.sh
./run_tabular_multi.sh

# Testing
source env_main/bin/activate
python test_multi_env_pipeline.py

# Check status
ls pipeline_output/
tail -f pipeline_execution.log
```
